# Glitter

A full stack social media website attempt at Twitter (Glitter was the first word that came to mind that rhymed).

The client side is built in HTML/CSS and React.js while the server side is built with JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js.

A MongoDB Atlas database is used to store the users, posts, etc. and the client side queries the server side using Apollo GraphQL.

The purpose of this project was to learn about full stack development while learning and working with React.js as well as GraphQL.
